> Writing about StirHack16, the first hackathon I ever attended, brings me very good memories. In this page I will focus on the project itself, although some day I should write about the hackathon experience. ðŸ˜ƒ

Android application with Google Maps API interface to help hackathon participants. The app provides the following information: List of upcoming hackathons, their position on Google Maps, and points of interest such as restaurants and hotels around the event.
