## üëã Hola! Hello! Hallo!
<!-- {style="text-align: justify;"} -->
</br>

I am a PhD candidate at [Matthias Nie√üner](http://niessnerlab.org/members/matthias_niessner/profile.html)'s [Visual Computing Group](http://niessnerlab.org/team.html), at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/). 
{style="text-align: justify;"}

I'm interested in computer vision, deep learning and optimization. My research is mostly focused on robust correspondence estimation for rigid 3D reconstruction.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Before joining the group, I received a Master's Degree in Computer Science from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the [Polytechnical University of Catalonia](https://www.tum.de/).
