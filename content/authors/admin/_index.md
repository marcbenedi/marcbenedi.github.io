I am an M.Sc student at the Technical University of Munich. In 2018, I received a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the Polytechnical University of Catalonia, Barcelona Tech. From January 2018 until May 2018, I took part in the Erasmus mobility program, in which I was studying at the University of Edinburgh.

I'm focusing on Computer Vision & Graphics, and Deep Learning areas. My current research interests are 3D Scanning, Computer Vision & Graphics and Visual Computing.
