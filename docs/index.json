In their work, they present a method to calculate deformation fields between shapes embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^D$. To do so, they compute a divergence-free deformation field represented in a coarse-to-fine basis using the Karhunen-Loéve expansion.\n   Example of parts of a shape moving in different directions in the same part of the space [1]  Our Contribution As stated by the original authors, one of the limitations of their work is in movements where different parts of the shape move through the same region of the embedding space in a contradictory manner. Their method cannot model such deformation because a vector field can only contain a single vector per point in space.\nTo overcome this limitation, Eisenberger suggested using time-dependent vector fields, such that a vector at a given point in space can change over time. For that, we solve correspondence and matching problems for the whole sequence during optimization.\nResults        Notes   https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10417\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1587945600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587945600,"objectID":"dd59133bf9171110663488389c32beac","permalink":"https://marcb.pro/project/idp/","publishdate":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/idp/","section":"project","summary":"We are extending the paper “Divergence-Free Shape Correspondence by Deformation” and representing a motion sequence as a time dependent vector field.","tags":["Shape Analysis","Computer Graphics","Optimization"],"title":"Divergence-Free Shape Correspondence with Time Dependent Vector Fields","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

It was the first problem proven to be NP-Complete which allowed reducing many NP-Complete problems to it. Because of this, it is one of the pillars of Computer Science.\nAn extension to SAT is Pseud-Boolean optimization problems. Unlike SAT, which can only express binary relationships among variables, Pseudo-Boolean optimization can formalize more complex relationships. These problems are defined in the following manner:\n   Pseudo-Boolean Optimization formulation. Figure source: MPBO A Distributed Pseudo-Boolean Optimization Solver [1]  Example: Knapsack problem    Source [2]  Given a set of items, each one with a value and a weight, and a knapsack with a maximum capacity, the goal is to select some objects to put inside the knapsack in a way that the weight is not bigger than the knapsack’s capacity and the total value is maximised.\nThe variables for this problem, given $n$ objects, are: $$o_1, o_2, \\ldots , o_n \\text{for the objects}$$ $$w_1, w_2, \\ldots , w_n \\text{for the weights}$$ $$v_1, v_2, \\ldots , v_n \\text{for the values}$$ There is only one constraint which represent the maximum capacity of the knapsack problem: $$w_0 o_0 + w_1 o_1+ \\ldots w_n o_n \\leq knapsack\u0026rsquo;s \\ capacity$$ And the cost function: $$v_0 o_0 + v_1 o_1+ \\ldots v_n o_n $$\nSAT Solvers A SAT solver is a tool that aims at solving Boolean Satisfiability problems. However, they take as input Boolean formulas in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). In this project, we propose an efficient encoding for converting Pseudo-Boolean minimisation problems into CNF constraints. If this encoding is not efficient, the size and difficulty of the problem can increase exponentially.\nProposed encoding The proposed encoding is based on the idea that if a function\u0026rsquo;s primes cover a small space then a lot of clauses will be required when encoding it into a CNF.
