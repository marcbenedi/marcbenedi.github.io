Advantages In the following sections, I will explain how to run VSCode inside Slurm[3].\nThis solves the problem of adding load to the login node. Additionally, since the code editor process will live inside a Slurm job, we will be able to debug and run code directly in the job. That‚Äôs very convenient!\nüßë‚Äçüíª The easy solution: VSCode on the web! This solution is super simple to set up! It consists of running code-server[5] as a Slurm job and accessing it through the web browser.\nFirst, we need to install the binary in our system. There are many options for that, so just pick up the most convenient for you. See the list of options here. In my case, I choose the Standalone release and put the binary in my path.\nSecond, we will create a job file, for example code-server.job, with the following content:\n#!/bin/bash #SBATCH --job-name=code-server #SBATCH --time=04:00:00 #SBATCH --output=%x_%j_%N.log #SBATCH --mem=8gb #SBATCH --gpus=1 #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4 #SBATCH -p submit PASSWORD=1234 # TODO: Change to secure password PORT=$(python -c \u0026#39;import socket; s=socket.socket(); s.bind((\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, 0)); print(s.getsockname()[1]); s.close()\u0026#39;) echo \u0026#34;********************************************************************\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;Starting code-server in Slurm\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;Environment information:\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;Date:\u0026#34; $(date) echo \u0026#34;Allocated node:\u0026#34; $(hostname) echo \u0026#34;Node IP:\u0026#34; $(ip a | grep 131.159) echo \u0026#34;Path:\u0026#34; $(pwd) echo \u0026#34;Password to access VSCode:\u0026#34; $PASSWORD echo \u0026#34;Listening on:\u0026#34; $PORT echo \u0026#34;********************************************************************\u0026#34; PASSWORD=$PASSWORD code-server --bind-addr 0.0.0.0:$PORT --auth password --disable-telemetry ‚ùó Remember to change the password! ‚ùó\nFinally, once the job has started, we can open the editor using any web browser and navigating to the IP of the node and the PORT.\nThat‚Äôs it!\nIf the node is not accessible from the Internet, use port-forwarding https://coder.com/docs/code-server/latest/guide#port-forwarding-via-ssh.\nüë∑ The complex solution: Start your own sshd process If you are up for a more complex solution or use other IDEs like PyCharm, you can use the next configuration. It involves starting sshd in a Slurm job and then connecting our IDEs to the new process (instead of the global sshd process).\nStep 1: Create the SSH keys ssh-keygen -t rsa -f .ssh/vcg_cluster_user_sshd Then, copy the generated keys to the login node. (We assume here that the user‚Äôs home directories are accessible on all nodes).\nStep 2: sshd Slurm job Copy the following content to a new file such as sshd.job.\n#!/bin/bash #SBATCH --job-name=sshd #SBATCH --time=04:00:00 #SBATCH --output=%x_%j_%N.log #SBATCH --mem=8gb #SBATCH --gpus=1 #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4 #SBATCH -p submit PORT=$(python -c \u0026#39;import socket; s=socket.socket(); s.bind((\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, 0)); print(s.getsockname()[1]); s.close()\u0026#39;) echo \u0026#34;********************************************************************\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;Starting sshd in Slurm as user\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;Environment information:\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;Date:\u0026#34; $(date) echo \u0026#34;Allocated node:\u0026#34; $(hostname) echo \u0026#34;Node IP:\u0026#34; $(ip a | grep 131.159) echo \u0026#34;Path:\u0026#34; $(pwd) echo \u0026#34;Listening on:\u0026#34; $PORT echo \u0026#34;********************************************************************\u0026#34; /usr/sbin/sshd -D -p ${PORT} -f /dev/null -h ${HOME}/.ssh/vcg_cluster_user_sshd Step 3: Test the connection At this point, you should be able to connect using ssh to the Slurm job.\nssh user@node -p \u0026lt;PORT where the server started\u0026gt; -i ~/.ssh/vcg_cluster_user_sshd Notice that the ssh session can only see the resources allocated to the job (for example the gpus).\nStep 4: Connect your IDE Finally, use your IDEs ‚ÄúRemote Connection‚Äù feature to connect to the job.\nStep 5: Remember to end the sshd process It is important to cancel the Slurm job when we don‚Äôt need the sshd listening anymore.\nüìë References [1]: https://code.visualstudio.com/\n[2]: https://www.lunarvim.org/\n[3]: https://slurm.schedmd.com/\n[4]: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/getting-started.html\n[5]: https://coder.com/docs/code-server/latest\n","date":1691413829,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691413829,"objectID":"54309b017a1d0dbe44e3ffc7e91bd44e","permalink":"https://marcb.pro/post/vscode-slurm/","publishdate":"2023-08-07T15:10:29+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/vscode-slurm/","section":"post","summary":"Although I don‚Äôt use Visual Studio Code[1] as a code editor (I use Neovim[2] ü¶∏), many colleagues use it as their primary editor.\n(The solution presented here also works for PyCharm[4]!","tags":["Slurm","VSCode","PyCharm"],"title":"Using VSCode in Slurm","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"We present an end-to-end learnable, differentiable method for pairwise relative pose registration of RGB-D frames.

It was the first problem proven to be NP-Complete which allowed reducing many NP-Complete problems to it. Because of this, it is one of the pillars of Computer Science.\nAn extension to SAT is Pseud-Boolean optimization problems. Unlike SAT, which can only express binary relationships among variables, Pseudo-Boolean optimization can formalize more complex relationships. These problems are defined in the following manner:\nPseudo-Boolean Optimization formulation. Figure source: MPBO A Distributed Pseudo-Boolean Optimization Solver [1] Example: Knapsack problem Source [2] Given a set of items, each one with a value and a weight, and a knapsack with a maximum capacity, the goal is to select some objects to put inside the knapsack in a way that the weight is not bigger than the knapsack‚Äôs capacity and the total value is maximised.\nThe variables for this problem, given $n$ objects, are: $$o_1, o_2, \\ldots , o_n \\text{for the objects}$$ $$w_1, w_2, \\ldots , w_n \\text{for the weights}$$ $$v_1, v_2, \\ldots , v_n \\text{for the values}$$ There is only one constraint which represent the maximum capacity of the knapsack problem: $$w_0 o_0 + w_1 o_1+ \\ldots w_n o_n \\leq knapsack‚Äôs \\ capacity$$ And the cost function: $$v_0 o_0 + v_1 o_1+ \\ldots v_n o_n $$\nSAT Solvers A SAT solver is a tool that aims at solving Boolean Satisfiability problems. However, they take as input Boolean formulas in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). In this project, we propose an efficient encoding for converting Pseudo-Boolean minimisation problems into CNF constraints. If this encoding is not efficient, the size and difficulty of the problem can increase exponentially.\nProposed encoding The proposed encoding is based on the idea that if a function‚Äôs primes cover a small space then a lot of clauses will be required when encoding it into a CNF.
